## Objectives:

- **Day 1:** Understand NMOS/PMOS regions; simulate Id–Vds/Id–Vgs.  
- **Day 2:** Study velocity saturation; perform load line analysis.  
- **Day 3:** Learn CMOS VTC; simulate switching threshold (Vm).  
- **Day 4:** Transient analysis; calculate rise/fall propagation delays.  
- **Day 5:** Optimize PMOS/NMOS sizing; apply to STA and clock tree design.
